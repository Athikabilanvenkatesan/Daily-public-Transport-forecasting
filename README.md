# Daily-public-Transport-forecasting
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time-Series Forecasting on public transport passenger journey data to predict future ridership trends. The insights generated can help optimize transport schedules, improve capacity planning, and drive better decision-making for public transportation authorities.


## Project Overview

### Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Visualizing trends, seasonality, and distributions to understand the data.
### Modeling:
Applying time-series forecasting models to predict future passenger journeys.
### Evaluation: 
Assessing the forecasting model's performance and making recommendations based on the predictions.
